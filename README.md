# Analyzing-Wikipedia-Clickstreams-with-PySpark
Wikipedia maintains a dataset called “Clickstream” that records clicks between pairs of linked Wikipedia articles
In this project, I am going to be working with Wikipedia’s open-source datasets. Wikipedia maintains a dataset called “Clickstream” that records clicks between pairs of linked Wikipedia articles. Because not all readers arrive at a Wikipedia article by clicking a link from another, the dataset also includes categories for clicks that originate outside of Wikipedia (e.g., external-search tracks all clicks coming from major search engines).

My code is located in the jupyter notebook.
